## Overview and Origin

* Founded in 2016 by Chris Rawley, Captain, US Navy Reserve

* Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas

* The founder developed an appreciation for agriculture by seeing how it was impacted by war during his military career.  He wanted to support local farms and ranches but learned how difficult it is for individuals when he looked for investment oppotunites.  His idea was to facilitate the kind of investment he wanted to participate in, making it accessible to more farmers, ranchers and investors.

* The company has raised over $11M since opening.


## Business Activities:

* Individual investors do not have as much access to invest in specific agricultural ventures as larger organizations, small farmers do not have many options besides taking on debt to fund their operations; Harvest Returns serves both of these groups by facilitating investment in deserving agricultural pursuits.

* The intended customers are both the individual investors looking to bolster their portfolio with agricultural assets and the farmers who would like to take on investors rather than debt.  Harvest Returns provides the expertise and technology to analyze and vet potential investment targets, as well as the regulatory guidance investors need.

* Harvest Returns harnesses white label SaaS offerings like [CrowdEngine](https://www.crowdengine.com/), [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) and [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/) for UI/UX, while [FundAmerica](https://www.fundamerica.com/) and [PrimeTrust](https://www.primetrust.com/) provide know-your-customer compliance support, escrow and other financial services for their backend.  They are equipped to handle cryptocurrency investments, but have not at this point.  They also partnedred with [Agritecture](https://www.agritecture.com/), a farm planning and tracking SaaS offering, and the CEO sits on the board of [AgroFides](https://agrofides.com/), a company offering finance solutions to farmers in Africa.


## Landscape:

* Harvest Returns operates in the crowdfunding and RegTech domains.

* With the passing of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act in April of 2012, crowdfunding quickly became a viable source of capital for many ventures that did not have access to traditional funding.  Startups with little or no marketing budget can leverage social media to raise awareness of their projects and target potential investors.

* Other crowdfunding companies focusing on agriculture include:
    * [FarmFunder](https://www.farmfundr.com)
    + [FarmTogether](https://farmtogether.com)
    - [One to One](https://www.onetoonecf.com)


## Results

* Harvest Returns reports (as of April 14, 2021):
    - 23 Farms & Ranches funded
