# [Harvest Returns - Agricultural Crowdfunding](https://www.harvestreturns.com/)

![](jpeg+high+res.jpg)

## Overview and Origin

* Founded in 2016 by Chris Rawley (CEO) and Austin Maness (COO)

* Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas

* The founders developed an appreciation for agriculture seeing how it was impacted by war during their military careers.  They wanted to support local farms and ranches but encountered obstacles when they looked for investment opportunities.  Their idea was to facilitate the kind of investment they wanted to participate in, making it accessible to more farmers, ranchers and investors.

* The company has raised over $11M since opening.


## Business Activities:

* Individual investors do not have as much access to invest in agricultural ventures as larger organizations, and small farmers do not have many options besides taking on debt to fund their operations; Harvest Returns serves both of these groups by facilitating investment in deserving agricultural pursuits.

* The intended customers are both the individual investors looking to bolster their portfolio with agricultural assets and the farmers who would like to take on investors rather than debt.  Harvest Returns provides the expertise and technology to analyze and vet potential investment targets, as well as the regulatory guidance investors need.

* Harvest Returns harnesses SaaS offerings like [CrowdEngine](https://www.crowdengine.com/), [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) and [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/) for UI/UX, while [FundAmerica](https://www.fundamerica.com/) and [PrimeTrust](https://www.primetrust.com/) provide know-your-customer compliance, escrow and other financial services for their back end.  They are equipped to handle crypto-currency investments, but have not at this point.  They also partnered with [Agritecture](https://www.agritecture.com/), a farm planning and tracking SaaS company, and the CEO sits on the board of [AgroFides](https://agrofides.com/), a company providing finance solutions to farmers in Africa.  Social media is a major part of their marketing strategy.


## Landscape:

* Harvest Returns operates primarily in the crowdfunding domain.

* With the passing of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act in April of 2012, crowdfunding quickly became a viable source of capital for many ventures that did not have access to traditional funding.  Startups with little or no marketing budget can leverage social media to raise awareness of their projects and target potential investors.

* Other crowdfunding projects focusing on agriculture include:
    * [FarmFunder](https://www.farmfundr.com)
    + [FarmTogether](https://farmtogether.com)
    - [One to One](https://www.onetoonecf.com)


## Results

* Harvest Returns reports (as of April 14, 2021):
    - 23 farms & ranches funded
    - Over $11M raised
    - $1.8M distributed to investors

* Beyond the high financial performance, the company proved to be capable of providing critical services in the midst of the food scares caused by the pandemic in 2020.  The effects of adding sustainable, decentralized, regenerative, local food sources will compound and add resilience to communities worldwide.

* FarmFundr reports they raised $2M and funded 2 farms in the last 5 years.


## Recommendations

* To further expand the potential customer base and put more capital into ethical agriculture, I recommend Harvest Returns consider an Initial Coin Offering (ICO).  While it might seem like too much of a risk at this point, more people are shifting assets into the crypto realm every day and issuing tokens would further lower the barrier to entry for this extremely critical but overlooked industry.  Combined with a social media campaign where token holders vote on where to send their contribution, the ICO will not only promote their core value of democratizing food production but also fund a sustainable food source and raise awareness for their company and all participating agricultural projects, even if the campaign is only a small part of their overall strategy.
