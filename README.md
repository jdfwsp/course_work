## Overview and Origin

* Founded in 2016 by Chris Rawley, Captain, US Navy Reserve

* Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas

* The founder developed an appreciation for agriculture by seeing how it was impacted by war during his military career.  He wanted to support local farms and ranches but learned how difficult it is for individuals when he looked for investment oppotunites.  His idea was to facilitate the kind of investment he wanted to participate in, making it accessible to more farmers, ranchers and investors.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?


## Business Activities:

* Individual investors do not have as much access to invest in specific agricultural ventures as larger organizations, small farmers do not have many options besides taking on debt to fund their operations; Harvest Returns serves both of these groups by facilitating investment in deserving agricultural pursuits.

* The intended customers are both the individual investors looking to bolster their portfolio with agricultural assets and the farmers who would like to take on investors rather than debt.  Harvest Returns provides the expertise and technology to analyze and vet potential investment targets, as well as the regulatory guidance investors need.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)


## Landscape:

* Harvest Returns operates in the crowdfunding and RegTech domains.

* With the passing of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act in April of 2012, crowdfunding quickly became a viable source of capital for many ventures that did not have access to traditional funding.  Startups with little or no marketing budget can leverage social media to raise awareness of their projects and target potential investors.

* Other crowdfunding companies focusing on agriculture include:

* Harvest Returns reports (as of April 14, 2021):
    - 23 Farms & Ranches funded
    - Over $11M raised
    - $1.8M distributed to investors
